# json_path_parser
Script that gives the path of the keys in the json file.

## Purpose

To write a json file to a sql based table, it must define the path of the keys. In large documents, this is difficult. At the same time, the probability of making mistakes is high.

## How it works?

This can be automated with the main.py script. You can convert it by entering the path of the json file as in the example below.

```
python main.py 'example_data.json'
```
